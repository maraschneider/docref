meta_title: "DocRef - Trustworthy recommendationsâ€¨ by doctors for your condition."
meta_description: "Online reviews of doctors are normally written by patients,
who evaluate their treatment quality different to an experienced doctor.
On DocRef, only doctors write recommendations for other doctors.
A cardiologist may be excellent in treating arteriosclerosis,
but may be less experienced in other fields.
DocRef recommendations are based on conditions and not just specialties.
Doctor reviews can easily be faked and manipulated across the internet.
That is why all doctors on DocRef are verified clinicians."
